                        Are you or your child curious about how the mind works? We invite children, teens, 
                        and adults to take part in research on how we remember, imagine, and think about the world!

                        <br>
                        By joining a study, you'll help us better understand how the brain and thinking change as people grow and contribute 
                        to discoveries that could support learning and well-being in childhood and beyond.

                <p>
                    We study how people of different ages remember the past and imagine the future. 
                    Participants might complete interactive tasks like computer games, 
                    storytelling, puzzles, or optional brain imaging (MRI). Our studies are designed to be 
                    fun and age-appropriate and your time is always appreciated and compensated with cash and sometimes bonus prizes.

            <name>Frequently Asked Questions</name>
            <question>Who Can Participate?</question>
            <p> 
                We welcome participants of all ages! 
                We're especially excited to hear from families with 
                children, as many of our studies focus on how thinking develops over time.
            </p>

            <question>What will we do during the visit?</question>
            <p> 
                You or your child will complete fun, research-based activities like 
                memory games, puzzles, or short interviews. Some studies may include a 
                visit to a mock MRI scanner (a kid-friendly pretend version), or an 
                optional real MRI session.
            </p>

            <question>How long does a study visit take?</question>
            <p>
                Most visits take 1 to 2 hours, depending on the study. 
                We'll always let you know what to expect ahead of time—and we 
                do our best to keep things fun and flexible.
            </p>

            <question>Will we be paid?</question>
            <p>
                Yes! Participants usually earn $10-$25 per hour, 
                and younger kids may also receive stickers, small prizes, 
                or certificates of participation.
            </p>

            <question>Can I stay with my child?</question>
            <p>
                Absolutely! We ask that you remain nearby, whether the study is in person or 
                virtual. For in-person visits, parents, siblings, or another close support 
                person are welcome to stay in our family-friendly waiting room just next to 
                the lab. We want everyone to feel comfortable and supported throughout the visit.
            </p>

            <question>Is participation voluntary?</question>
            <p>
                Yes. Participation is always voluntary, and you or your child can stop at any 
                time. We're happy to answer questions before, during, or after your visit.
            </p>

            <question>Where is the lab? What's the space like?</question>
            <p>
                The FLAME Lab is located in the Behavioral Sciences Building at the University of 
                Illinois Chicago (UIC). We're easy to get to - just off the main road, near public transit 
                (including a Blue Line stop), and close to nearby parking.
