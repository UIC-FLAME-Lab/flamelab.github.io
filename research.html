                    <p>
                    Episodic memory helps us remember past events and supports flexible thinking. 
                    By forming connections between multiple memories, we are able to infer new knowledge, 
                    come up with creative ideas, and imagine possible future events. Our research examines 
                    how developmental differences in how events are encoded, organized, and retrieved in memory 
                    impacts these other cognitive abilities. Some specific questions include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>How do children develop the ability to encode and retrieve relations between events in memory?</li>

                    <p>
                        Our episodic memories fuel forms of flexible thinking. Imagining future events involves recombining remembered content, 
                        generating creative ideas benefits from retrieving multiple events, and new knowledge can be inferred from linking remembered 
                        events. Our research examines how children engage in these abilities, focusing on the neurocognitive mechanisms that support their 
                        development. We're particularly interested in how top-down control processes interact with episodic memory to support this development. 
                        Some specific questions include:    
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is the developmental trajectory of future event imagination, creative idea generation, and inferential reasoning?</li>

                            <li>What is the role of top-down control processes?</li>
                            <li>How do brain structure and function support development?</li>

                    <h1>ROLE OF EXPERIENCE IN EPISODIC FUTURE THINKING</h1>
                    <p> 
                        Research suggests individuals imagine possible future events by retrieving and recombining content from multiple 
                        memories to construct events that might possibly happen to us. If this is true, then the future events children and adults 
                        imagine may be constrained by what they've already experienced. There is also evidence that what individuals have experienced—such 
                        as environmental enrichment and adversity—may impact neural regions critical for future event imagination. Our research examines 
                        whether past experiences influence the type of future events individuals imagine as well as the neural mechanisms that support this ability. Some questions include:
                        <ul>
                          <li>To what extent are imagined future events constrained by experience?</li>
                          <li>Are indirect experiences (e.g., books or stories) incorporated?</li>

                        Forms of flexible cognition enable individuals to create novel content, like imagined future events and creative ideas. 
                        This novel content may help them adapt to changing environments and promote resilience. Our research examines the connection between 
                        flexible cognition and resilience. Some questions include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do individual differences relate to adaptive behavior?</li>
