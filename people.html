                        <b>Bio:</b> Kate earned her B.A. at Temple University with a major in psychology and a minor in cognitive neuroscience. During her time at Temple, she 
                        worked on an honors thesis with Dr. Peter Marshall in the Developmental Science Lab on finger independence using EEG. After graduation, Kate stayed at 
                        Temple to work with Drs. Nora Newcombe and Ingrid Olson in the Kid Memory Lab studying the development of episodic memory in kids ages 4-9 through behavior

                        <b>Research Interests:</b> Kate is passionate about exploring the development of neural mechanisms underpinning episodic memory development across the lifespan. 
                        Additionally, she is intrigued by the impact and outcomes of creativity on the salience of memories over time. Kate is also dedicated to community outreach, 
                        with a strong focus on promoting inclusion among minority groups in research.

                        <b>Bio:</b> Berit earned her B.S. degree in psychology from the University of Würzburg in Germany. Her Bachelor’s thesis comprised a 
                        cognitive psychological experiment in the area of empirical aesthetics measuring how art experts and laypeople differ in their mental processing of art. 
                        She earned her M.S. degree in psychology from the University of Zurich in Switzerland. There, she continued her journey in cognitive psychology and focused 
                        on memory research. This culminated in a metascientific Master's thesis which involved the attempt to measure theoretical progress on the basis of scientific 
                        text taking the memory decay theory and its development over time as example. She is a PhD student in the Brain & Cognitive Sciences area at UIC.

                        contexts forget certain things rather than others. How memories are incorporated to form a concept of the future intrigues her. She’s greatly enthusiastic 
                        about metascientific approaches to improve psychological science.

                        lives and to encourage broader participation in research studies. In her clinical practice, she incorporates evidence-based approaches to deepen her 
                        understanding of trauma and inform her work with clients. Her interests include how past experiences shape individual perception and the factors that 
                        contribute to resilience and post-traumatic growth.
